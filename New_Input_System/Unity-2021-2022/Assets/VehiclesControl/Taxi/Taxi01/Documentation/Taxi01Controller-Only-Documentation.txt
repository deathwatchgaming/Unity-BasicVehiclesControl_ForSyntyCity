"Taxi01DevScene" Scene Setup Steps
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description:

Create a basic Vehicle Controller for your Unity projects using vehicle models
from Synty Polygon City Asset.

Vehicle Controls: 
-----------------

Vehicle Forward:   W [Keyboard] / Left Stick [Gamepad]
Vehicle Reverse:   S [Keyboard] / Left Stick [Gamepad]
Vehicle Left:      A [Keyboard] / Left Stick [Gamepad]
Vehicle Right:     D [Keyboard] / Left Stick [Gamepad]
Vehicle Brake:     Space [Keyboard] / Right Trigger [Gamepad]


Manual Setup Instruction:
-------------------------

* Simply follow the instruction for manual setup found below.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prep Step: Create New Scene Called: "Taxi01DevScene"

Note: if you already have some sort of a test terrain in place, well then, you
can simple skip the steps: #1, 2 & 3 and go directly to #4.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Create: "Environment" * (for Nicer Organization)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create Empty: "Environment"

Position: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

First since this is just a "holder" added for better organization, let us go
ahead & drag the "Directional Light" into "Environment".

* also if you wanted you could add a "dir" called Environment and opt to place
  your TerrainData inside that in its own Dir "TerrainData" and as such any
  other Environment stuff respectively in as desired the "Environment" dir.
  Just a suggestion.

Also: We don't need the "Main Camera" in Sample Scene, so..., we can go ahead
and delete it.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Create: "Terrain Plane"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create New 3D Object: "Plane"

Position: X: 0   Y: -0.03 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0   Y: 0     Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 100 Y: 1     Z: 100

Rename to: "Terrain Plane"

We can now opt to clean up for better organization, simply drag the:
"Terrain Plane" into the holder "Environment" we added for just this exact
 purpose!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Create: "Terrain"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create New 3D Object: "Terrain"

Modify via:

"Terrain" Inspector: Terrain Settings

Position: X: -500 Y: 0 Z: -500 
Rotation: X: 0     Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1     Y: 1 Z: 1

We can now opt to clean up for better organization, simply drag the:
"Terrain" into the holder "Environment" we added for just this exact purpose!


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Create: empty "Vehicle"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Create Empty: "Vehicle"

Position: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes: Current Summary

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: Ok, by now your scene heirarchy at top should look like this:

Environment
Vehicle


Nice and organized right?! :) Good Stuff! ;)

Note: as this uses a vehicle from such and due to licensing such vehicles
cannot be included in this repository obviously, as such the provided scripts
and instructions thus require having / purchasing the:

Synty Polygon City Asset:

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/polygon-city-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-95214


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5: Install: "Synty Polygon City Asset"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Depending on how you purchased you can either use the package manager to
install the asset or if you are like me and say already have local repository
storage of purchased assets and have the package already you can install the
asset manually.


Asset package to install:

 POLYGON City - Low Poly 3D Art by Synty.unitypackage

https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/urban/polygon-city-low-poly-3d-art-by-synty-95214


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6: Identify: the "Vehicle Prefab"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Let us first identify and locate the "Vehicle Prefab" we are going to use.

Assets > PolygonCity > Prefabs > Vehicles

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi_01


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Add: the "Vehicle Prefab" to Scene

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Drag the mentioned "Vehicle Prefab" into the scene & unpack the prefab completely.

Next, rename the vehicle prefabs:

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi_01 => "Taxi01"

Next, set the Transform:

Position: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

Material: PolygonCity_Mat_01_A

Then move "Taxi01" into the empty: "Vehicle" as child of.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 8: Add: empty "View" as child

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In "Taxi01" add empty as child named "View"

Set the Transform of "View":

Position: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 9: Add: "Camera" in empty "View" as child

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In the empty: "View" add "Camera" component named: "Taxi01Camera"

Tag: Untagged

Depth: 0

Set the Transform of "Taxi01Camera":

Position: X: 0 Y: 1.4 Z: -6.4 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 10: Add: empty "WheelMeshes" as child

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In "Taxi01" add empty as child named "WheelMeshes"

Set the Transform of "WheelMeshes":

Position: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

Copy & paste the following meshes into "WheelMeshes" as children
(delete originals after as they are not needed since we copied them into new
location)

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr  

Transforms should be fine and unaffected but, let us just mention them for
good measure.

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl
---------------------------

Position: X: -0.7449768 Y: 0.361439 Z: 1.632266
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr
---------------------------

Position: X: 0.7449768 Y: 0.361439 Z: 1.632266 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl
---------------------------

Position: X: -0.7449768 Y: 0.361439 Z: -1.24979 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr
---------------------------

Position: X: 0.7449768 Y: 0.361439 Z: -1.24979
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 11: Duplicate: empty "WheelMeshes" as "WheelColliders"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In "Taxi01" duplicate "WheelMeshes" & rename to "WheelColliders"

Set the Transform of "WheelColliders":

Position: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1


Since you duplicated "WheelMeshes" & renamed to "WheelColliders" there should
be the children already present with matching infos...

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr  


Prior to the deletion of contents in WheelColliders if you desired to
determine the wheel radius so as to eventually use with Wheel Colliders well,
you could attach a Sphere Collider and gain Radius from that and then delete
the sphere collider after as such would no longer be necessary but instead to
avoid needing to do such I will provide that info so you do not necessarily
need to do so.

These details are important:


Front Wheels:
-------------

Front Wheels Collider Radius: 0.361439
Front Wheels Collider Position Y: 0.511439 (0.361439+0.15) *

* Wheel colliders need +0.15 on the Y to function as intended as per
  documentation

Rear Wheels:
------------

Rear Wheels Collider Radius: 0.361439
Rear Wheels Collider Position Y: 0.511439 (0.361439+0.15) *

* Wheel colliders need +0.15 on the Y to function as intended as per
  documentation

In "WheelColliders" children: * (since all are already present in WheelMeshes
and not needed for Wheel Colliders)

* Delete Mesh Filter
* Delete Mesh Renderer

Add Component "Wheel Collider" to each:

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl
SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr   

Set both front "Wheel Colliders" radius: 0.361439
Set both rear  "Wheel Colliders" radius: 0.361439

We will need to now edit these infos:


SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl
---------------------------

Position: X: -0.7449768 Y: 0.5114391 Z: 1.632266
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr
---------------------------

Position: X: 0.7449768 Y: 0.5114391 Z: 1.632266
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl
---------------------------

Position: X: -0.7449768 Y: 0.5114391 Z: -1.24979
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr
---------------------------

Position: X: 0.7449768 Y: 0.5114391 Z: -1.24979
Rotation: X: 0 Y: 0 Z: 0 
Scale:    X: 1 Y: 1 Z: 1

Notes: Current Summary

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: Ok, by now your vehicle heirarchy should look like this:

Mostly Collapsed:

Vehicle
  Taxi01
    SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Glass
    SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Plates
    SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_SteeringW 
    WheelMeshes
    WheelColliders   
    View

Fully Expanded:

Vehicle
  Taxi01
    SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Glass
    SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Plates
    SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_SteeringW
    WheelMeshes

      SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl
      SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr   
    View
      Taxi01Camera


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 12: Add to: Taxi01 (Taxi01Controller.cs)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Attach component / script (Taxi01Controller.cs) to "Taxi01"

Adjust the following settings:

Require Components:
-------------------

Rigidbody: Taxi01 (Rigidbody)

Wheel Transforms:
-----------------

Front Left: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl (Transform)
Front Right: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr (Transform)
Rear Left: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl (Transform)
Rear Right: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr (Transform)

WheelColliders:
---------------

Front Left: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fl (Wheel Collider)
Front Right: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_fr (Wheel Collider)
Rear Left: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rl (Wheel Collider)
Rear Right: SM_Veh_Car_Taxi01_Wheel_rr (Wheel Collider)

In Rigidbody:
-------------

Set Rigibody Mass: 2000


Input Actions:
--------------

Car Controls: CarControls (Input Action Asset)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 13: Add to: Taxi01Camera (Taxi01Camera.cs)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Attach component / script (Taxi01Camera.cs) to "Taxi01Camera"


Adjust Settings:

Transforms:
-----------

Taxi01: Taxi01 (Transform)


You can keep settings as is or tweak them to your likings! *

* ie: (tweak camera height)

Height: 3.16


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ok, hopefully I covered everything. You should now be able to drive around your
scene with your vehicle. 

Note: The next and last step would be to now follow the provided vehicle
specific controller only in scene setup add speedometer setup steps found via
the documentation folder ie:

Taxi01Controller-Only-Speedometer-Documentation 

to finalize all setups steps.  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional: (Controller only) Compass Usage

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note: Lastly, if you would like to have the compass for controller only usage
you need to next follow the Vehicle Compass (Controller Only) setup steps to
finalize that part of the setup steps found via the NavigationControl
specific vehicle directory documentation folder ie:

Taxi01-Controller-Only-Compass-Documentation


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


That should about sums it up and should be about it and concludes the basic
Vehicle Controller manual setup steps. You can now begin to modify such
further for your specific needs.

Best of Luck!
