NOTE: There is currently a bug in Unity 6 that affects wheel colliders and
center of gravity offset. This bug has been reported and is listed as a bug
and is currently being worked on for an official fix. Until such we can
provide a temporary resolution file to add to your vehicle to sort this out.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Modify in: Each vehicle controller (Center of Gravity Offset)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Zero out: "0" the center of gravity offset in your vehicle controller first


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Add to: Each vehicle controller (COGWheelColliderEnabler.cs)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Make sure that you Zeroed out: "0" the center of gravity offset in your
vehicle controller first as this temp resolution script replaces such for
now

Next, Add: COGWheelColliderEnabler.cs script to each vehicle

Next, Add just one of any one of the wheel colliders for the vehicle to the
script input for wheel collider
